			<h4><a href="#">Grand Master Choa Kok Sui</a></h4>

			<p>Grand Master Choa Kok Sui (August 15, 1952 â€“ March 19, 2007) is the founder of Modern Pranic healing and Arhatic Yoga. Grand Master Choa Kok Sui is credited with the development of an energy healing system using more effectively and efficiently prana or ki, which is the life force that keeps the body alive. Albeit a trained Chemical Engineer and successful businessman, he spent more than 30 years researching and studying literature and books on esoteric sciences, examining and sorting through their various healing techniques, and eventually developing the concepts, principles, techniques, and practical applications of Pranic healing as it is widely known today.<br />
			</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Born on August 15, 1952 in Cebu, Philippines and raised in a multi-faith environment, Master Choa Kok Sui found himself inclined to paranormal and spiritual matters from the tender age of 12. As a teenager, he spent a year doing inner purification, laying the foundation for his ventures into the spiritual path. He also lived a simple life, akin to that of a yogi, refusing the comforts that he could otherwise have easily afforded.<br />
			  As a young man, Master Choa Kok Sui studied a wide range of healing arts (notably at a time when they were not yet validated as sciences), achieving a kind of encyclopedic level of knowledge on the subject matter. He studied under spiritual guides, who themselves were spiritually advanced and extraordinarily powerful healers, and whose guidance were inevitably crucial to the development of Modern Pranic healing .<br />
			  In his spiritual journey, Master Choa Kok Sui made close associations with yogis, healers, clairvoyants, practitioners of Chinese chi kung (the art of generating internal power), and persons who were in telepathic contact with their spiritual gurus. He studied yoga, psychic phenomenon, mysticism, Chinese chi kung, Rosicrucian Teachings of the Ancient Mystical Order of Rosae Crucis (AMORC), Theosophy, Astara lessons, Arcane School teachings, and other esoteric sciences.<br />
			  Throughout 1983 to 1987, Master Choa Kok Sui worked on the completion of what was his Spiritual Thesis: he labored over the monumental tasks of synthesizing, experimenting, validating, conceptualizing, formulating, systematizing and developing the bulk of what would become Modern Pranic Healing and Arhatic Yoga.<br />
